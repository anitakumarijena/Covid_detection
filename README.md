# Covid_detection
In this notebook,I used this  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset">CoronaHack-Chest X-Ray-Dataset</a> from Kaggle to get the data of X-ray images to
and predict the whether a person having corona or  not based on this.

This dataset includes :

* test and train folder which contain Pneumonia  and normal X-ray images
* Metadata.csv which contain 5800 + Chest - X Ray Image name , Image Labels ( Healthy person or Pneumonia due to (Bacteria , Virus) ðŸ¦  and related categories )
* Summary.csv which contain summary information about the Labels ( Level 1 , Level 2 & Level 3 ) and number of images

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the fashion-minst-sprite.  While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Cloth differtiator` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Cloth differtiator.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Cloth differtiator.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
